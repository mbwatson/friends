# Flask, BeautifulSoup, and Friends

Choose a season of Friends, and you'll find a list of the episodes in that season and the popularity of the season's Wikipedia page (in terms of the number of hits it has received in the last 60 days).

# Why was this made?

This project was made quickly late one night to learn a little about using Python to do two things:

* Serving up dynamic web pages with [http://flask.pocoo.org/](Flask) and
* Web scraping with [https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/](BeautifulSoup).
